# stationFeedbackDB

In order to use this early stage of the database, all that should be required is mariaDB installed, and a handful of python3 packages (numpy, astropy, MySQLdb, scipy and ftplib).
Pull this repo into a directory, and then manually run databaseCore.py to setup the initial SQL database and bring database up-to-date. databaseCore.py can then be setup as a cron job to periodically update the SQL databases.

TO DO:
1. Add a station reference file which is sourced by all the individual scripts.
2. Add better recording of how many observations your station has been involved in (or data quantity recorded).
3. Write a report generation script - allow you to set a start and end date for the report (default to quarterly report).
