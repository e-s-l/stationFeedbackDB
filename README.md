# stationFeedbackDB

TO DO:
1. Add a station reference file which is sourced by all the individual scripts.
2. Add better recording of how many observations your station has been involved in (or data quantity recorded).
3. Write a report generation script - allow you to set a start and end date for the report (default to quarterly report).
